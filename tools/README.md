## ctfd_download.py
Script to interface the CTFd API.

When the CTF starts:
- Create category/challname/ with a README.md of the challenge description, and downloads handouts.
After the CTF:
- Create README.md with challenge summary, points, solves etc.
- Create scoreboard.md (or append to README.md) with the top10 (and your team if you failed to get there)

Highly opinionated :)
